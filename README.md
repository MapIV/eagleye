## What is Eagleye

Eagleye is an open-source software for vehicle localization utilizing GNSS and IMU[[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329619280_Low-cost_Lane-level_Positioning_in_Urban_Area_Using_Optimized_Long_Time_Series_GNSS_and_IMU_Data). Eagleye provides highly accurate and stable vehicle position and orientation by using GNSS Doppler[[2]](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsaeronbun/44/1/44_20134048/_article/-char/en)[[3]](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsaeijae/3/2/3_20124032/_article/-char/ja)[[4]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6236946)[[5]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290751834_Automotive_positioning_based_on_bundle_adjustment_of_GPS_raw_data_and_vehicle_trajectory)[[6]](https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10029931657/). The flowchart of the algorithm is shown in the figure below. The algorithms in this software are based on the outcome of the research undertaken by [Machinery Information Systems Lab (Meguro Lab)](https://www2.meijo-u.ac.jp/~meguro/index.html) in Meijo University.

## Getting started

### Hardware
**GNSS receiver**
* [Ublox NEO-M8T](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neolea-m8t-series) / [EVK-M8T](https://www.u-blox.com/product/evk-8evk-m8)
* [Ublox ZED-F9P](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zed-f9p-module) / [C099-F9P](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/c099-f9p-application-board)

**GNSS Antenna**

* [Ublox ANN-MB Series](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ann-mb-series)
* [Tallysman TW2710](http://www.tallysman.com/index.php/gnss/products/antennas-gpsbeidougalileoglonass/tw2710/)

**IMU**
* [Tamagawa Seiki TAG300 Series](http://mems.tamagawa-seiki.com/en/product/)
* [ANALOG DEVICES ADIS16475](https://www.analog.com/products/adis16475.html#product-overview)

**Wheel speed sensor**

Eagleye uses vehicle speed acquired from CAN bus.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone and Build MapIV's fork of [RTKLIB](https://github.com/MapIV/RTKLIB/tree/rtklib_ros_bridge). You can find more details about RTKLIB [here](http://www.rtklib.com/).

		cd $HOME  
		git clone -b rtklib_ros_bridge https://github.com/MapIV/RTKLIB.git
		cd $HOME/RTKLIB/lib/iers/gcc/  
		make   
		cd $HOME/RTKLIB/app  
		make   

2. Clone and build [rtklib_ros_bridge](https://github.com/MapIV/rtklib_ros_bridge).

		cd $HOME/catkin_ws/src  
		git clone https://github.com/MapIV/rtklib_ros_bridge.git  
		cd ..  
		catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  

3. RTKLIB settings.

Change `inpstr1-path` of `$HOME/RTKLIB/app/rtkrcv/conf/rtklib_ros_bridge_sample.conf` according to the serial device you use.

ie)
>inpstr1-path =/serial/by-id/usb-u-blox_AG_-_ www.u-blox.com_u-blox_GNSS_receiver-if00:9600:8:n:1:off  

Or you can specify device port like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.

4. GNSS receiver settings.
Configure the receiver settings using [u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/product/u-center).

* Enable UBX message â€» Set to output only RAWX and SFRBX

Further details will be provided later.

5. Check the rotation direction of z axis of IMU being used. If you look from the top of the vehicle, if the left turn is positive, set "reverse_imu" to `true` in `eagleye/launch/eagleye_localization.launch`.

		param name="/eagleye/reverse_imu" type="bool" value="true"


### Running eagleye node

1. Check if wheel speed (vehicle speed) is published in `/can_twist` topic.

* Topic name: /can_twist
* Message type: geometry_msgs/TwistStamped twist.liner.x


2. Check if the IMU data is published in `/imu_raw` topic.

3. Start RTKLIB.

		cd $HOME/RTKLIB
		bash rtklib_ros_bridge_sample.sh

4. Check if RTKLIB is working by execute the following command in the terminal. If the RTKLIB is working correctly, positioning information is appeared continuously in the terminal.

		status 0.1  

5. Start rtklib_ros_bridge.

		rosrun rtklib_bridge rtklib_bridge   

6. Start eagleye.

		roslaunch eagleye_core eagleye_localization.launch

## Sample data

Sample data to test Eagleye is available from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4757p5m1qk4iuub/eagleye_sample.bag?dl=0). This sample data is collected along this [route](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1pK4BgrGtoo14nguArDf-rZDqIL5Cg-v5) in Nagoya. The 3D maps of the route is also available as [Autoware sample data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uwp9vwvcZwaoZi4kdjJaY55-LEXIzSxf/view).
